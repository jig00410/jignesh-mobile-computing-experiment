# Experiment 2: Frequency Re-use Visualization

This project provides an interactive GUI to understand frequency reuse and co-channel cell identification.

## How to use
1. Run the script `frequency_reuse_gui.py`.
2. Enter the values for **i** and **j** in the terminal.
3. The GUI will calculate the cluster size $N = i^2 + ij + j^2$ and display the grid.
4. Click on hexagons to identify co-channels.
